\eoce{\qt{GRE scores, Part I\label{GRE_intro}} Sophia who took the Graduate Record 
Examination (GRE) scored 160 on the Verbal Reasoning section and 157 on the 
Quantitative Reasoning section. The mean score for Verbal Reasoning section 
for all test takers was 151 with a standard deviation of 7, and the mean 
score for the Quantitative Reasoning was 153 with a standard deviation of 
7.67. Suppose that both distributions are nearly normal. 
\begin{parts}
\item Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.
\item What is  Sophia's Z-score on the Verbal Reasoning section? On the 
Quantitative Reasoning section? Draw a standard normal distribution curve and 
mark these two Z-scores.

\eoce{\qt{Triathlon times, Part I\label{triathlon_times_intro}} In triathlons, it 
is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups. Friends Leo and 
Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo competed in the 
\textit{Men, Ages 30 - 34} group while Mary competed in the \textit{Women, 
Ages 25 - 29} group. Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds), while 
Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds). Obviously Leo finished 
faster, but they are curious about how they did within their respective 
groups. Can you help them? Here is some information on the performance of 
their groups:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item The finishing times of the \textit{Men, Ages 30 - 34} group has a mean 
of 4313 seconds with a standard deviation of 583 seconds.
\item The finishing times of the \textit{Women, Ages 25 - 29} group has a 
mean of 5261 seconds with a standard deviation of 807 seconds.
\item The distributions of finishing times for both groups are approximately 
Normal.
\end{itemize}
Remember: a better performance corresponds to a faster finish.
\begin{parts}
\item Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.
\item What are the Z-scores for Leo's and Mary's finishing times? What do 
these Z-scores tell you?
\item Did Leo or Mary rank better in their respective groups? Explain your 
reasoning.
\item What percent of the triathletes did Leo finish faster than in his group?
\item What percent of the triathletes did Mary finish faster than in her 
group?
\item If the distributions of finishing times are not nearly normal, would 
your answers to parts (b)~-~(e) change? Explain your reasoning.

model that assumes returns on a portfolio are normally distributed. Suppose a 
portfolio has an average annual return of 14.7\% (i.e. an average gain of 
14.7\%) with a standard deviation of 33\%. A return of 0\% means the value of 
the portfolio doesn't change, a negative return means that the portfolio 
loses money, and a positive return means that the portfolio gains money.
\begin{parts}
\item What percent of years does this portfolio lose money, i.e. have a 
return less than 0\%?

\begin{parts}
\item Write the probability model for the distribution of temperature in 
\degree C in June in LA.

genetic blood disorder where red blood cells lose their flexibility and 
assume an abnormal, rigid, ``sickle" shape, which results in a risk of 
various complications. If both parents are carriers of the disease, then a 
child has a 25\% chance of having the disease, 50\% chance of being a 
carrier, and 25\% chance of neither having the disease nor being a carrier. 
If two parents who are carriers of the disease have 3 children, what is the 
probability that 
\begin{parts}
\item two will have the disease?
\item none will have the disease?
\item at least one will neither have the disease nor be a carrier?
\item the first child with the disease will the be $3^{rd}$ child?
\end{parts}

\eoce{\qt{Roulette winnings\label{roulette_winnings}} In the game of roulette, a 
wheel is spun and you place bets on where it will stop. One popular bet is 
that it will stop on a red slot; such a bet has an 18/38 chance of winning. 
If it stops on red, you double the money you bet. If not, you lose the money 
you bet. Suppose you play 3 times, each time with a \$1 bet. Let Y represent 
the total amount won or lost. Write a probability model for Y.

\eoce{\qt{Multiple choice quiz\label{mc_quiz}} In a multiple choice quiz there are 
5 questions and 4 choices for each question (a, b, c, d). Robin has not 
studied for the quiz at all, and decides to randomly guess the answers. What 
is the probability that
\begin{parts}
\item the first question she gets right is the $3^{rd}$ question?
\item she gets exactly 3 or exactly 4 questions right?
\item she gets the majority of the questions right?

\eoce{\qt{Exploring permutations\label{explore_combinations}} The formula for the 
number of ways to arrange $n$ objects is $n! = n\times(n-1)\times \cdots 
\times 2 \times 1$. This exercise walks you through the derivation of this 
formula for a couple of special cases.

\indent A small company has five employees: Anna, Ben, Carl, Damian, and 
Eddy. There are five parking spots in a row at the company, none of which are 
assigned, and each day the employees pull into a random parking spot. That 
is, all possible orderings of the cars in the row of spots are equally likely.
\begin{parts}
\item On a given day, what is the probability that the employees park in 
alphabetical order?
\item If the alphabetical order has an equal chance of occurring relative to 
all other possible orderings, how many ways must there be to arrange the five 
cars?
\item Now consider a sample of 8 employees instead. How many possible ways 
are there to order these 8 employees' cars?

\eoce{\qt{Male children\label{male_children}} While it is often assumed that the 
probabilities of having a boy or a girl are the same, the actual probability 
of having a boy is slightly higher at 0.51. Suppose a couple plans to have 3 
kids. 
\begin{parts}
\item Use the binomial model to calculate the probability that two of them 
will be boys.
\item Write out all possible orderings of 3 children, 2 of whom are boys. Use 
these scenarios to calculate the same probability from part (a) but using the 
addition rule for disjoint outcomes. Confirm that your answers from parts (a) 
and (b) match.
\item If we wanted to calculate the probability that a couple who plans to 
have 8 kids will have 3 boys, briefly describe why the approach from part (b) 
would be more tedious than the approach from part (a).

\eoce{\qt{Sampling at school\label{sampling_at_school}} For a sociology class 
project you are asked to conduct a survey on 20 students at your school. You 
decide to stand outside of your dorm's cafeteria and conduct the survey on a 
random sample of 20 students leaving the cafeteria after dinner one evening. 
Your dorm is comprised of 45\% males and 55\% females.
\begin{parts}
\item Which probability model is most appropriate for calculating the 
probability that the $4^{th}$ person you survey is the $2^{nd}$ female? 
Explain.
\item Compute the probability from part (a).
\item The three possible scenarios that lead to $4^{th}$ person you survey 
being the $2^{nd}$ female are
\[ \{M, M, F, F\}, \{M, F, M, F\}, \{F, M, M, F\} \]
One common feature among these scenarios is that the last trial is always 
female. In the first three trials there are 2 males and 1 female. Use the 
binomial coefficient to confirm that there are 3 ways of ordering 2 males and 
1 female. 
\item Use the findings presented in part (c) to explain why the formula for 
the coefficient for the negative binomial is ${n-1 \choose k-1}$ while the 
formula for the binomial coefficient is ${n \choose k}$.

\eoce{\qt{Serving in volleyball\label{serving_volleyball}} A not-so-skilled 
volleyball player has a 15\% chance of making the serve, which involves 
hitting the ball so it passes over the net on a trajectory such that it will 
land in the opposing team's court. Suppose that her serves are independent of 
each other.
\begin{parts}
\item What is the probability that on the $10^{th}$ try she will make her 
$3^{rd}$ successful serve?
\item Suppose she has made two successful serves in nine attempts. What is 
the probability that her $10^{th}$ serve will be successful?
\item Even though parts (a) and (b) discuss the same scenario, the 
probabilities you calculated should be different. Can you explain the reason 
for this discrepancy?
